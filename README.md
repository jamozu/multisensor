# Multi-Sensor
This project consists of a module that manages different sensors for home use. The idea is to be able to mix and match different sensors, according to the requirements of each area of the house, using a single PCB design and a configurable sketch, making it easier to setup and maintain a sensor network.

The sensor module is based on the MySensors library using an ArduinoÂ® Mini Pro, which has a good number of interface pins, it has a small footprint and is suited for running on batteries, with the NRF24L01 radio module for wireless communication.
